    "2. Assume I have 25,000 data, either threshold generates (2,5000 X 2,5000)/2 unique pairs --(tweetA and tweetC) is the same as (tweetC and tweetA). This means I have more than 312 million pairs. If the 0.3 threshold generates 1 million dupe pairs, then 0.5 threshold could make 1.5 million dupe pairs, and 0.6 threshold could make 2 million dupe pairs. If I randomly select 100 pairs from either threshold result, it high likely will be all Non-dupe/ or all dupe in all three-threshold result, so the example table doesn't show comparison purpose at all.\n",

Then I find dupe pairs that recognized from 0.5 not 0.3, and take 25 pairs sample from the difference. These 25 will be non-dupe for 0.3 threshold and dupe for 0.5 threshold. Lastly, I find dupe pairs that recognized by 0.6 threshold and not by 0.5, take 25 pairs sample from it."
